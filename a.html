            <p>The following two laws of chemical
            combination were established after much
experimentations by Lavoisier and Joseph
L. Proust.</p>
<div class="container"><h2><small>3.1.2</small> LAW OF CONSTANT PROPORTIONS</h2></div>
<mark>Lavoisier</mark>, along with other scientists, noted
that many compounds were composed of two
or more elements and each such compound
had the same elements in the same
proportions, irrespective of where the
compound came from or who prepared it.
In a compound such as water, the ratio of
the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen
is always <code> 1:8</code>, whatever the source of water.
Thus, if 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of
hydrogen and 8 g of <abbr title="oxygen">O<sub>2</sub></abbr> are always
obtained. Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and
hydrogen are always present in the ratio <code> 14:3 </code>
by mass, whatever the method or the source
from which it is obtained.
<blockquote class="blockquote">This led to the law of constant proportions
which is also known as the law of definite
proportions. This law was stated by Proust
as <footer class="blockquote-footer"> â€œIn a chemical substance the elements are
always</footer></blockquote>
